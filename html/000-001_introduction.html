    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>ErlMUD is a game system written in Erlang. My real purpose in writing it and this code commentary is to demonstrate how a simple Erlang project evolves to become a production-style OTP system. (Playing games on it is fun, too, and keeps things interesting!)</p>
    <p>I don't cover any basics of the Erlang language here, <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/">Learn You Some Erlang</a> and <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/jaerlang2/programming-erlang">Programming Erlang</a> already do a better job of that than I ever could. If you are new to Erlang its probably a good idea to work through the parts of those books that cover the language before tackling anything beyond the first or second section of this commentary. If you are familiar with Erlang but don't really understand what OTP is about, or understand how to write a simple OTP application but wonder what to look out for when deploying production systems then ErlMUD is for you.</p>
    <p>Erlang the language is fairly simple (yay!), but Erlang the system is not. Understanding the fundamentals of concurrency and message protocols, learning large new libraries and the details of a new runtime system, using new profiling tools, understanding the quirks of release building, and utilizing the much-talked-about-but-little-used hot code upgrade capabilities is anything but easy. While language tutorials and elementary resources that walk the reader through toy systems are sufficient to demonstrate the language and give good hints of how to build small releases, the only way to really grasp the difference between a relatively simple, non-OTP system written in raw Erlang and a production-style OTP system is to watch a single project evolve from a basic concept demonstration to a production system.</p>
    <p>Reading code can be hard. Understanding the interactions within a software system can be hard. I think the best way to approach learning an operation environment is to stick with the same project concept the whole way through so the reader isn't spending more time understanding how the project system works than understanding the platform system that is the point of the demonstration. To relieve the reader of the burden of understanding new project mechanics every chapter, I've instead decided to make the entire demonstration center around just ErlMUD so we can describe the way the game system works just once, and then focus on how the imlpementation of it evolves over time.</p>
