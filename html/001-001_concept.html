    <h1>ErlMUD Concepts</h1>
    <p>Erlmud is a simple Multi-User Dungeon that runs over TCP.</p>
    <p>It is written in a way that takes advantage of Erlang's ability to model elements of a system
    as independent processes which communicate only by passing messages
    and dependent on the few promises provided by the Erlang runtime.</p>
    <h2>Elements</h2>
    <p>The primary elements we want to deal with in a MUD are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>locations</li>
      <li>objects</li>
      <li>mobile entities</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A location is a space within which play can occur.
    Locations connect to other locations and travel is affected
    by having an entity leave one location as it enters another.
    The idea that locations must connect to one another to form a map,
    and that this map must make enough sense to players that
    it forms the basis for a playable world will inform our decisions
    about how to design a process that represents a location,
    what responsibilities a location might take on,
    and what (if any) accessory processes a location may require
    in the support of fulfilling its role.</p>
    <p>Objects are things which are not mobile or alive.
    Within this broad definition of objects
    we find anything else in the world that might not be alive but is also not a location:
    weapons, armor, consumables, light sources, money, clothing, food, containers, etc.
    The idea that some items may have a limited lifespan,
    and therefore have a way of being created and destroyed,
    picked up, placed within containers, act as containers, and
    maintain enough state to influence other elements of the game system
    tells us that the design of object processes is not entirely simple,
    and may not even fit within a single definition
    (a food object may need to be different from a weapon object,
    but adhere to a similar generic interface of "object").</p>
    <p> A mobile entity (aka "mob") is the real point of the game.
    Mobs are what do the verby things in MUDs.
    They are the world creatures, the NPCs, the player avatars, the predators and the prey.
    Without them the MUD would be a pretty boring place.
    Knowing that all the above types of characters and creatures which occur in MUDs are mobs indicates a few things.
    Namely, that while a general definition of mob may suffice,
    the controlling elements that make decisions for mobs may require a bit of diversification.</p>
    <p> The above three elements form the basis for the game itself,
    but this tells us nothing about how they should be created, managed,
    found within the game system, communicated with, or really anything else about the system.</p>
    <p> In terms of an Erlang program this is actually OK.
    With just this limited definition we can begin to explore the problem space in more depth
    first by thinking through the basic problem of how to initialize such a system of objects,
    and then by writing some elementary wishful-thinking code that describes the ideas in more detail.</p>
