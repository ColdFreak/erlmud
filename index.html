    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>tl;dr: A non-trivial project in Erlang accompanied by extensive commentary which illustrates various methods for building production systems.</p>
    <h2>That's too simple. Really, what is it?</h2>
    <p>ErlMUD is a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game system that runs over TCP. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate various  Erlang styles commonly found in the wild by detailing the evolution of this project between them. ErlMUD is a sort of Rosetta Stone for Erlang projects. It starte with an informally specified "actor" concept, moves through various styles of raw Erlang and basic OTP, and ends with a maintainable system based on OTP.</p>
    <p>The goal is to cover — by direct exploration and encounter in code — at least a few of the common pitfalls, "boilerplate code" situations, useful abstractions and techniques which have evolved over the years into idiomatic raw Erlang and idiomatic OTP. A secondary goal is to illustrate that raw Erlang is not the same thing as idiomatic OTP.</p>
    <p>The final evolutions of the code are production-style OTP systems, intended to fill in the gaps often left by other Erlang learning resources. Quite often a newcomer to Erlang focuses intensely on early learning materials, mastering the bits and pieces of the language, basic OTP concepts, details of functional programming and the Erlang library, and at the end of this arduous road are left wondering how to put what they have learned into action on a real production system.</p>
    <p>With any luck, examination of the ErlMUD commentary and the various evolutions of the ErlMUD code will demonstrate concrete answers to at least some of the questions intermediate Erlang users often ask themselves and demonstrate solutions to situations that often leave newcomers scratching their heads. While examination of the code may provide quick answers so some how-to questions, the commentary is necessary to and explain the tradeoffs made in various places to explain why things are the way they are.</p>
    <h2>Who are you?</h2>
    <p>A nobody, really. The details of my life are quite inconsequential.</p>
    <h2>What now?</h3>
    <p>At the expense of violating DRY... <a href="html/index.html">Read it online</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zxq9/erlmud">explore the repository</a>.</p>
