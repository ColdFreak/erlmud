    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>tl;dr: A non-trivial project in Erlang accompanied by extensive commentary which illustrates various methods for building production systems.</p>
    <h2>That's too simple. Really, what is it?</h2>
    <p>ErlMUD is a Multi-User Dungeon game system that runs over TCP. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate various  Erlang styles commonly found in the wild by detailing the evolution of this project between them. Starting with an informally specified concept "actor" based system, moving through various styles of raw Erlang and basic OTP, and ending with a maintainable system based on OTP, ErlMUD is a sort of Rosetta Stone for Erlang projects. The hope here is to cover, by direct exploration and encounter in code, at least a few of the common pitfalls, "boilerplate code" situations, useful abstractions and techniques which have evolved over the years into idiomatic raw Erlang and idiomatic OTP. The final evolutions of the code are production-style OTP systems, intended to fill in the gaps left by other Erlang learning resources. Quite often a newcomer to Erlang focuses intensely on early learning materials, mastering the bits and pieces of the language, basic OTP concepts, details of functional programming and the Erlang library, and at the end of this arduous road are left, like a non-mechanic handed a box containing a disassmbled motorcycle, how to put the bits and pieces they have learned into action on a non-trivial production system. With any luck, examination of the ErlMUD commentary and the various evolutions of the ErlMUD code will demonstrate concrete answers to at least some of the places newcomers are often left scratching their heads, and explain the tradeoffs made in various places to explain why things are the way they are.</p>

    <p>A nobody, really. The details of my life are quite inconsequential.</p>
